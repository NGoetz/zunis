ZÃ¼NIS documentation
==============================================


This is a work-in-progress library to provide importance sampling Monte-Carlo integration tools based on
Neural imporance sampling `[1]`_. This method uses normalzing flows to optimally sample
an integrand function in order to evaluate its (multi-dimensional) integral.

The goal is to provide a flexible library to integrate black-box functions for which classical methods such as VEGAS do
not work well due to an unknown or complicated structure which prevents the typical variable change and multi-channelling
tricks.
